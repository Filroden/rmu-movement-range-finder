# Version History

| Version | Changes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Version 1.4.0** | **IMPROVEMENTS**<br>- **Pace Boundaries and Anchor colour**: Added thin boundary lines for each pace limit and added an additional colour for the anchor area (configurable in Game Settings).|
| **Version 1.3.0** | **NEW FEATURES**<br>- **Gridless Pathfinding (Theta\* Algorithm)**: Added organic pathfinding for Gridless maps. The module dynamically generates an invisible "micro-grid" combined with Euclidean line-of-sight math to draw smooth, circular movement areas that gracefully flow around corners and walls.<br>- **Performance vs. Fidelity Slider:**: Added a new game setting to control the resolution of the Gridless micro-grid. Players on powerful PCs can lower the pixel size for smoother shapes, while users on older machines can increase the size for faster calculations.<br><br>**BUG FIXES**<br>- **Large Token Wall Leaks**: Fixed a bug where massive tokens (e.g., dragons) placed flush against walls would "leak" their starting movement footprint into adjacent rooms. Footprint calculations are now strictly bound by Line-of-Sight on Square, Hex, and Gridless maps.|
| **Version 1.2.0** | **IMPROVEMENTS**<br>- **Faster Calculations:** Overhauled the underlying pathfinding engine. Calculating massive movement ranges (100+ feet) on complex maps is now about 5% faster.<br>- **Lag-Free Token Dragging:** Built a "smart memory" system for the visual overlay. Moving your token around the map to preview paths is now much smoother.<br><br>**BUG FIXES**<br>- Fixed to prevent module trying to display movement paths for invalid actor types.|
| **Version 1.1.0** | **NEW FEATURES**<br>- **Full Hex Grid Support**: Hex grids now get the same love as square grids, showing the full possible path based on wall geometry and the 1 AP boundary limit.<br>- **Smart Pathing**: Implemented a "Jump & Bridge" algorithm to handle odd wall angles on hex maps.<br>- **Ghost Snapping**: Added "Ghost" highlighting for movement paths that bridge gaps (like narrow corridors) but aren't valid stopping points (if snapping is on).<br><br>(Note: While highly accurate, hex grids in complex walled areas may still have minor edge cases due to geometry limitations.)<br><br>**IMPROVEMENTS**<br>- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Fixed "wall leaks" on Square grids where tokens could previously glitch through diagonal walls.<br>* **Performance**: Optimised the pathfinding loop for better performance on large maps.<br><br>**REMOVED**<br>- **Gridless Mode**: Temporarily removed the experimental gridless support. It may return in a future major update with a dedicated physics-based pathfinding engine.|
| **Version 1.0.2** | **IMPROVEMENTS**<br>- Font size for distance label inside grids is now set to be 15% of the actual grid size, so scales with map resolution.|
| **Version 1.0.1** | **BUG FIXES**<br>- Fixed missing pace names in the game settings.|
| **Version 1.0.0** | **INITIAL RELEASE**<br>- **Anchor Reset:** Anchor position is persistent until reset. The default keypress to reset the Anchor point is Control-M.<br>- **Opacity:** Opacity can now be set in 0.05 steps. This is particularly useful for games where movement is usually taken as an action, and the colour fill of the grid is less relevant.<br>- **Grid borders:** Removed the heavier borders on grids in the "sprint" zone. On square grids there is still a thick outer boundary border drawn to represent the limit of 1AP / 1xBMR.|
| **Version 1.0.0-beta1** | **BETA 1 RELEASE**<br>- **Anchor & Scout System:** Move tokens to reveal fog without losing the movement origin point.<br>- **Pathfinding:** Full Dijkstra algorithm support for Square grids, respecting walls and doors.<br>- **Metric Support:** Auto-scaling for metric scenes.<br>- **Experimental Support:** Added opt-in support for Hex and Gridless maps.<br>- **Customisation:** Full control over colours, opacity, and rounding rules via Settings.|
